## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="Russian.jpg">

Hi! I am a Ph.D. student in the Thrust of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Guangzhou.

Before joining HKUST(GZ) in Sept. 2022, I did my master's research in the [School of Oceanography](https://soo.sjtu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong Universiy](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/), working with [Prof. Zhaoru Zhang](https://soo.sjtu.edu.cn/szTeachers/3589.html). I did some work in the Air-Ice-Sea interaction processes in the Southern Ocean (see my publications). I received my bachelor's degree of Petroleum Engineering in the [School of Petroleum Engineering](http://pe.upc.edu.cn/), [China University of Petroleum (East China)](https://www.upc.edu.cn/).

Now I am doing some Large Eddy Simulations in coastal sea surface and bottom boundary merging processes under the guidance of [Prof. Qing Li](https://qingli411.github.io/index.html).
